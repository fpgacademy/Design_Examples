\subsection{Video-out Port}
\label{sec:video_out}

The {\it \systemNameFull} includes a video-out port connected to the on-board
\videoOutDevice~controller that can be connected to a standard
\videoOutDevice~monitor. The video-out port support a screen resolution
of 640 $\times$ 480. The image that is displayed by the video-out port is
derived from two sources: a {\it pixel} buffer, and a {\it character} buffer.
