\section{Exceptions and Interrupts}
\label{sec:exceptions}

The reset address of the Nios II processor in the \systemName~is set to
{\sf 0x00000000}. The address used for all other general exceptions, such as 
divide by zero, and hardware IRQ interrupts 
is {\sf 0x00000020}. Since the Nios II processor uses the same address for general
exceptions and hardware IRQ interrupts, the
Exception Handler software must determine the source of the exception by examining the
appropriate processor status register. Table \ref{tab:irq}
gives the assignment of IRQ numbers to each of the I/O peripherals in the \systemName.
The rest of this section describes the interrupt behavior associated with the interval
timer, parallel ports, and serial ports in the \systemName.
