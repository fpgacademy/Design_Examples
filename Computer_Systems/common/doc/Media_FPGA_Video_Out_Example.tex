\subsubsection{Using the Video-out Port with C code}

A fragment of C code that uses the pixel and character buffers is shown in 
Listing \ref{lst:video_C}.  The first {\bf for} loop in the figure draws a rectangle in 
the pixel buffer using the color {\it pixel\_color}. The rectangle is drawn using the
coordinates $x_1, y_1$ and $x_2, y_2$.  The second {\bf while} loop in the 
figure writes a null-terminated character
string pointed to by the variable {\it text\_ptr} into the character buffer at the
coordinates {\it x}, {\it y}.
