\subsubsection{7-Segment Displays Parallel Port}

There are two parallel ports connected to the 7-segment displays on the \DEBoard~board, each of
which comprises a 32-bit write-only {\it Data} register. As indicated in 
Figure \ref{fig:hex_segment_port}, the register at address {\sf 0xFF200020} 
drives digits {\it HEX3} to {\it HEX0}, and the register at 
address {\sf 0xFF200030} drives digits {\it HEX5} and
{\it HEX4}.  Data can be written into these two registers, and read back, by using word operations. 
This data directly controls the segments of each display, according to
the bit locations given in Figure \ref{fig:hex_segment_port}. The locations of segments 
6 to 0 in each seven-segment display on the \DEBoard~board is illustrated on the right side of the
figure.
