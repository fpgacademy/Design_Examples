\subsubsection{DDR3 Memory}
\label{sec:ddr3}
A 1 GB DDR3 memory is connected to the HPS part of the
\FPGADeviceFamily~chip.  The memory is organized as 256M {\sf x} 32-bits, and is accessible 
using word accesses (32 bits), halfwords, and bytes. The {\processor} processor can access the 
DDR3 memory using the addresses space {\sf 0x40000000} to {\sf 0x7FFFFFFF}.
