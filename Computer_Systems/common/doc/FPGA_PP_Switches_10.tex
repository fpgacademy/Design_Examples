\subsubsection{Slider Switch Parallel Port}

The {\it SW}$_{9-0}$ slider switches on the \DEBoard~board are connected to an input parallel
port.  As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:slider_port}, this port 
comprises a 10-bit read-only {\it Data} register, which is mapped to address {\sf 0xFF200040}.
