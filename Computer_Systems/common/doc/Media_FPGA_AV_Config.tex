\subsection{Audio/Video Configuration Module}

The audio/video configuration module controls settings that affect the operation
of both the audio port and the video-out port. The audio/video configuration module
automatically configures and initializes both of these ports whenever the
{\it \systemNameFull} is reset. For typical use of the {\it \systemNameFull} it is not necessary
to modify any of these default settings.
