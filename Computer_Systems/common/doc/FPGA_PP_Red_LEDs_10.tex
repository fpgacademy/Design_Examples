\subsubsection{Red LED Parallel Port}

The red lights {\it LEDR}$_{9-0}$ on the \DEBoard~board
are driven by an output parallel port, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:LED_port}. The port
contains a 10-bit {\it Data} register, which has the
address {\sf 0xFF200000}.  This register can be written or read by the processor using word 
accesses, and the upper bits not used in the registers are ignored.
