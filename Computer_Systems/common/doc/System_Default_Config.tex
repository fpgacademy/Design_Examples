\section{Making the System the Default Configuration}
\label{sec:systempof}

The {\it \systemNameFull} can be loaded into the nonvolatile FPGA configuration memory on the
\DEBoard~board, so that it becomes the default system whenever the board is powered on.
Instructions for configuring the \DEBoard~board in this manner can be found in the tutorial
{\it Introduction to the Quartus Prime Software}, which is available as part of the
\texttt{Digital Logic Hardware Design} tutorials in the 
{\small \href{https://www.fpgacademy.org/tutorials.html} {FPGAcademy.org}} website.
