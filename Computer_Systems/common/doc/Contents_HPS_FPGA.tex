\section{\systemName~Contents}
A block diagram of the \systemName~system is shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:block_diagram}.  As indicated in the figure, the components in this system 
are implemented utilizing the {\it Hard Processor System} (HPS) and FPGA 
inside the \FPGADeviceFamily~chip. The HPS comprises an ARM* Cortex* A9 dual-core 
processor, a DDR3 memory port, and a set of peripheral devices. The FPGA 
implements two Altera Nios\textsuperscript{\textregistered} processors, and several 
peripheral ports: memory, timer modules, 
audio-in/out, video-in/out, PS/2, analog-to-digital, infrared receive/transmit, and 
parallel ports connected to switches and lights.  Instructions for using the Nios processors
are provided in a separate document, called {\it \systemName~System with Nios II/V}.
