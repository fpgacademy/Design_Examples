\subsubsection{SDRAM}
An SDRAM Controller in the FPGA provides an interface to the 64 MB synchronous dynamic RAM (SDRAM) 
on the \DEBoard~board, which is organized as 32M {\sf x} 16 bits. It is
accessible by the \processor~processor using word (32-bit), halfword (16-bit), or byte
operations, and is mapped to the address space {\sf 0x\baseAddressOffset 0000000} to {\sf 0x\baseAddressOffset 3FFFFFF}.
