\subsubsection{Second JTAG* UART}

The \systemName~includes a second JTAG UART that is accessible by the ARM A9 MPCORE.
This second UART is mapped to the base address {\sf 0xFF201008}, and operates as described
above. The reason that two JTAG UARTs are provided is to allow each processor in the ARM
A9 MPCORE to have access to a separate UART.
