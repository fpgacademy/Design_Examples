\subsection{G-Sensor}
\label{sec:hps_gsensor}
The \systemName~includes a 3D accelerometer (G-sensor) that is connected to the HPS. The accelerometer can be configured to produce two interrupt signals. One of
these signals is
used in our system and is connected to an I/O port on the HPS called GPIO2.
This I/O port has the same structure as GPIO1 which was described in Section \ref{sec:hps_gpio1}. The base address of GPIO2 is {\sf 0xFF70A000}. The accelerometer interrupt signal
is connected to bit 5 in the data register of GPIO2. 
The accelerometer generates an interrupt by driving
the interrupt signal high. The "interrupt"
signal is not connected to the generic interrupt controller (GIC) of the HPS, so to
check for interrupts the bit must be polled.
