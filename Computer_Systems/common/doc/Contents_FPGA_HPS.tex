\section{\systemName~Contents}
A block diagram of the {\it \systemNameFull}~is shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:block_diagram}.  As indicated in the figure, the components in this system 
are implemented utilizing both the FPGA and the {\it Hard Processor System} (HPS) inside 
the \FPGADeviceFamily~chip. 
The FPGA implements two \processor\textsuperscript{\textregistered} processors and 
several peripheral ports: memory, timer modules, audio-in/out, video-in/out, PS/2, 
analog-to-digital, infrared receive/transmit, and parallel ports connected to switches and 
lights.  The HPS comprises an ARM* Cortex* A9 dual-core processor and a set of peripheral 
devices.  Some of these HPS peripheral devices can be accessed by \processor. 
Instructions for using the HPS with the ARM processor can be found 
in the document entitled {\it \systemName~System with ARM* Cortex* A9},
which is available on the 
\href{https://www.fpgacademy.org/tutorials.html} {FPGAcademy.org} website.
