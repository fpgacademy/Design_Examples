\subsection{System ID}

The system ID module provides a unique value that identifies the \systemName~
system.  The host computer connected to the \DEBoard~board can query the
system ID module by performing a read operation through the JTAG port. The host computer can 
then check the value of the returned identifier to confirm that the \systemName~has 
been properly downloaded onto the \DEBoard~board.  This process allows debugging tools on the 
host computer, such as the \productNameMed{}, to verify that the 
\DEBoard~board contains the required computer system before attempting to execute code 
that has been compiled for this system.
