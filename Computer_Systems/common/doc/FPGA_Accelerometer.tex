\subsection {Accelerometer}

The \systemName~includes an ADXL345 3-axis digital accelerometer, which can be used to
measure acceleration on the board in three directions. The Accelerometer chip is controlled by the
Accelerometer SPI Mode core, which provides a memory-mapped interface at address {\sf 0xFF204020}
to {\sf 0xFF204021}, as shown in in Figure~\ref{fig:accel_port}.

The ADXL345 chip contains a series of 58 internal registers, {\sf 0x00} to {\sf 0x39}, which are
used to contol the device and store data. To access these registers, the address of the desired
register should be written to the {\it Address} register of the Accelerometer SPI Mode core.
Performing a read or write on the {\it Data} register will then read from or write to the 
requested address on the ADXL345. Commonly used registers of the accelerometer and their address
are listed in Table~\ref{tab:accel_regs}. For a full list of registers, consult the ADXL345 
datasheet.
