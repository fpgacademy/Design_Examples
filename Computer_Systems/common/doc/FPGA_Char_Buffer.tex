\subsubsection{On-Chip Memory Character Buffer}
An 8 KB memory is implemented inside the FPGA for use as a character buffer for the video-out
port, which is described in Section~\ref{sec:video_out}.
The character buffer memory is organized as 8K {\sf x} 8 bits, and spans the {\processor}
address range {\sf 0x\baseAddressOffset 9000000} to {\sf 0x\baseAddressOffset 9001FFF}.
