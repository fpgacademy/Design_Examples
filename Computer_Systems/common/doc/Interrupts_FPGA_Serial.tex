\subsection{Interrupts from the serial port UART}

We introduced the data and {\it Control} registers associated with the serial port UART in Figure
\ref{fig:serial_port}, in section \ref{sec:serial_port}.
The {\it RE} and {\it WE} bits in the {\it Control} register in Figure \ref{fig:serial_port} are used to 
enable processor interrupts associated with the receive and transmit FIFOs. When enabled, 
interrupts are generated when {\it RAVAIL} for the receive FIFO, or {\it WSPACE} for
the transmit FIFO, exceeds 31. Pending interrupts are indicated in the {\it Control}
register's {\it RI} and {\it WI} bits, and can be cleared by writing or reading data
to/from the UART.
