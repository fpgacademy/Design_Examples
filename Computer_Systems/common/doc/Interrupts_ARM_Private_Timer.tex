\subsection{Interrupts from the ARM* A9* Private Timer}

Figure~\ref{fig:MPCORE_timer}, in Section~\ref{sec:ARM_timers}, shows four registers that
are associated with the A9 private timer. As we said in Section \ref{sec:ARM_timers}, bit
{\it F} in the {\it Interrupt status} register is set to 1 when the timer reaches a count 
value of 0. It is possible to generate an A9 interrupt when this occurs, by using bit {\it I}
of the {\it Control} register.  Setting bit {\it I} to 1 causes the timer to send an
interrupt signal to the GIC whenever the timer reaches a count value of 0. 
The {\it F} bit can be cleared to 0 by writing writing a 1 into the 
{\it Interrupt status} register.
