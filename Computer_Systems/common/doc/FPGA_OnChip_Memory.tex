\subsubsection{On-Chip Memory}
A 256 KB memory is implemented inside the FPGA, organized as 64K {\sf x} 32 bits. The 
{\processor} processor can access this memory using addresses in the range 
{\sf 0x\baseAddressOffset 8000000} to {\sf 0x\baseAddressOffset 803FFFF}. This
memory is used as a pixel buffer for the video-out and video-in ports.
