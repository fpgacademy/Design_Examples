\subsubsection{Expansion Parallel Port}

The \systemName~includes one bidirectional parallel port that is connected to the
{\it \ExpansionPortA} expansion header on the \DEBoard~board. This parallel port
includes the four 32-bit registers that were described previously for 
Figure~\ref{fig:parallel_port}. The base address of this port is {\sf 0xFF200060}.
Figure \ref{fig:expansion_port}$a$ gives a diagram of 
the {\it JP1} expansion connector on the \DEBoard~board, and shows how the respective parallel port {\it Data} register bits, 
$D_{31-0}$, are assigned to the pins on the connector. The figure shows that bit $D_0$ of
the parallel port is assigned to the pin at the top right corner of the
connector, bit $D_1$ is assigned below this, and so on. Note that some of the pins on
{\it \ExpansionPortA} are not usable as input/output connections, and are 
therefore not used by the parallel ports. Also, only 32 of the 36 data pins that appear on
each connector can be used.

\subsubsection{Arduino* Expansion Parallel Port}

The \systemName~includes a bidirectional parallel port that is connected to the
Arduino* Uno R3 expansion header {\it JP2}/{\it JP3} on 
the \DEBoard~board.  This parallel port has the base address {\sf 0xFF200100} and includes the 
four 32-bit registers that were described previously for Figure~\ref{fig:parallel_port}.
The mapping of data bits from this port to the pins on {\it JP2} and {\it JP3} 
is illustrated in part~$b$ of Figure~\ref{fig:expansion_port}.
This mapping connects data bit 0 in the {\it Data} register 
to the signal {\it Arduino\_IO0}, data bit 1 to {\it Arduino\_IO1}, and so on.  

The \systemName~also includes a one-bit output parallel port that is connected to the
{\it Arduino\_Reset\_n} pin on header {\it JP8} on the \DEBoard~board.  
Data bit 0 of this one-bit output port is connected to pin 3 of {\it JP8}, which is the 
{\it Arduino\_Reset\_n} signal.  The address of this port is {\sf 0xFF200110}.

More details about the Arduino Uno R3 expansion header can be found in the 
\DEBoard~Board User Manual.
