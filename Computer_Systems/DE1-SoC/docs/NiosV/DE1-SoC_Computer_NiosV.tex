\subsection{Getting Started with the \systemNameFull}

To make use of the {\it \systemNameFull} you need to be able to assemble software programs 
for the {\processor} processor and then execute these programs in the computer system. There are 
two main approaches for getting started: using a simulation of the computer system, or
using an FPGA board that implements the computer system in hardware.

\subsubsection {Using the CPUlator Simulator}

The {\it CPUlator} is a powerful and easy-to-use functional simulator that runs inside a
web browser. It simulates the behavior of a whole computer system, including the
processor, memory, and many types of I/O devices. The CPUlator simulator supports a variety
of different computer systems, including the {\it \systemNameFull}. 

The CPUlator user interface displays all of the information that a programmer needs to
develop and debug software code running on the {\it \systemNameFull}. It shows (and allows
you to edit) the values in the processor general-purpose and control registers, as well as the 
contents of memories in the computer system and the values of memory-mapped I/O device 
registers. The CPUlator allows software code, written either in assembly language or the 
C language, to be entered into the simulator, assembled to produce machine code, loaded 
into memory, and then executed. The user can set breakpoints in the machine code, 
single-step instructions, and perform any of the usual operations that are supported in 
typical debugging environments. A screen capture of the CPUlator user interface is shown 
in Figure~\ref{fig:CPUlator}. It displays the processor registers on the 
left-hand side (by default) of the screen,
the program code in the middle, and graphical representations of I/O devices on the 
right-hand side.

   \end{center}
   \caption{The CPUlator.}
	\label{fig:CPUlator}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection {Using an FPGA Hardware Board}

The {\it \systemNameFull} can be implemented using a {\DEBoard} hardware
board.  An easy way to begin working with this hardware system is to make use of the tools
provided with the GNU Project Debugger (GDB) for Nios~V. Detailed instructions for setting up 
these GDB tools are given in the tutorial called {\it Using GDB with Nios V}, which is available
as part of the \texttt{Computer Organization and System Design} tutorials in the 
{\small \href{https://www.fpgacademy.org/tutorials.html} {FPGAcademy.org}} website.

\subsection{Nios\textsuperscript{\textregistered} V Processor}
\label{sec:niosV}
The Altera Nios\textsuperscript{\textregistered}~V processor 
is an implementation of the 32-bit RISC-V processor architecture. Three versions of 
Nios~V exist, each with different features and capabilities.  Documentation for these 
three versions, designated as {\it compact} (Nios~V/c), {\it microcontroller} (Nios~V/m),
and {\it general purpose} (Nios~V/g), can be found by searching on the Internet for keywords 
such as \texttt{Nios~V versions}. The {\it \systemNameFull}~includes two instances of 
the Nios~V/m version. An overview of the \processor~processor can be found in the 
document {\it Introduction to \processor}, which is available in the 
Tutorials tab of the 
{\small \href{https://www.fpgacademy.org/tutorials.html} {FPGAcademy.org}} website.

\subsubsection{Nios~V Machine Timer and Software Interrupt Registers}
\label{sec:mtimer}
Nios~V includes a 64-bit internal timer that can be used by application programmers. 
The timer is reset to 0 when the {\DEBoard} board is powered on, and then monotonically
increases at the system clock rate, which is 100~MHz. The timer is accessible via two 
memory-mapped registers, 
called {\it mtime} (machine time) and {\it mtimecmp} (machine time compare). The 
{\it mtime} register provides the current timer value, and the {\it mtimecmp} register 
can be used to cause a timer interrupt. A Nios~V timer interrupt will be pending whenever 
the value of {\it mtime} reaches or exceeds the value of {\it mtimecmp}. Interrupts are 
discussed in Section~\ref{sec:exceptions}.

Since they are 64-bits wide, both {\it mtime} and {\it mtimecmp} comprise two 32-bit 
memory-mapped registers, one for the {\it low} word and the other for the {\it high} word. 
Nios~V also contains a memory-mapped register called {\it msip} (machine software interrupt
pending), which can be used by an application programmer to cause a {\it software interrupt}.

The {\it mtime}, {\it mtimecmp} and {\it msip} memory-mapped registers are 
are illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:mm_control}, which gives the assigned address of each 
register in the {\it \systemNameFull}.

\begin{figure}[h]

   \caption{Nios~V memory-mapped registers.} 
	 \label{fig:mm_control}
	 \end{center}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Memory Components}

The {\it \systemNameFull} has SDRAM and DDR3 memory ports, as well as two memory modules 
implemented using the on-chip memory inside the FPGA. These memories are described below.

\section{Exceptions and Interrupts}
\label{sec:exceptions}

The reset address of the {\processor} processor in the {\it \systemNameFull} is set to
{\sf 0x00000000}. The address used for the trap handler for all other exceptions and 
interrupts can be set by the programmer (by writing to the {\it mtvec} control register). 
Table \ref{tab:irq} gives the assignment of IRQ numbers to each of the I/O peripherals in 
the system. The rest of this section describes the interrupt behavior associated 
with the Nios V machine timer, the FPGA interval timer, parallel ports, and serial ports.

\subsection{Interrupts from the Nios V Software Interrupts and Machine Timer}
The IRQ numbers for the Nios V software interrupts register and machine timer are not
system dependent and are part of the processor specification. The procedure that can be used
to set up and handle these interrupts is described in the 
document {\it Introduction to \processor}, which is available as part of the 
\texttt{Computer Organization and System Design} tutorials in the 
{\small \href{https://www.fpgacademy.org/tutorials.html} {FPGAcademy.org}} website.

\input{\commonPath/Interrupts_FPGA_PP.tex}
\input{\commonPath/Interrupts_FPGA_PP_Keys.tex}
\input{\commonPath/Interrupts_FPGA_JTAG_UART.tex}

\subsection{Using Interrupts with Assembly Language Code}

An example of assembly language code for the {\it \systemNameFull} that uses interrupts is
shown in Listing \ref{lst:interrupt_example_s}. When this code is executed on the
{\DEBoard} board it first sets up interrupts from three devices: the Nios~V machine timer, 
an FPGA interval timer, and the pushbutton KEY port. The code to initialize these devices
is given in Lines 141 to 175 in Part ($d$) of Listing \ref{lst:interrupt_example_s}. 
Line 24 in Listing \ref{lst:interrupt_example_s}($a$) initializes the stack pointer to
the bottom of the 64~MB SDRAM on the {\DEBoard}, and Lines 25 to 27 initialize the
three interrupting devices. Interrupts are enabled in Lines 30 to 37. First, the address of
the trap handler routine is written into the {\it mtvec} register, and then software
interrupts, machine timer, interval timer, and KEY port interrupts are
enabled by setting bits $b_3$, $b_7$, $b_{16}$ and $b_{18}$, respectively, of the 
machine interrupt enable ({\it mie}) register. 
Finally, interrupts are enabled in Nios~V by setting bit $b_3$ of the {\it mstatus} register.

Next, in Lines 40 to 42 the program makes a software 
interrupt occur, to illustrate how this is done. Finally, the main program loops in
between Lines 51 and 57 while responding to interrupts from the timers and the 
KEY pushbutton port. 

The trap handler is given in Lines 59 to 89. After first saving registers that will be
modified, it reads the value of the {\it mcause} register. Based on this value, the trap
handler calls the appropriate interrupt service routine. 

The interrupt service routine for the software interrupt, in Lines 91 to 97, 
turns on most of the red lights in the \red{LEDR} port, to provide a visual indication of 
its execution. 

The interrupt service routine for the Nios V machine timer, in Lines 99 to 114,
adjusts the {\it mtimecmp} value for the next interrupt, and 
increments a counter variable. The main program displays this counter as a binary number 
on the red lights \red{LEDR}, which will increment for every timer interrupt.

The interrupt service routine for the FPGA interval timer, in Lines 116 to 129,
increments a one-digit decimal counter. The main program displays this counter on the 
7-segment display \red{HEX0}. The counter either increments or decrements,
in the range \red{0} to \red{9}.  When a KEY is pressed, its corresponding 
interrupt service routine, in Lines 131 to 139, reverses the direction of counting on \red{HEX0}. 

The remaining lines of code, in Listing~\ref{lst:interrupt_example_s}($e$),
provide a subroutine for converting decimal digits to 7-segment display codes,
and define the global variables that are used in the program.

\subsection{Using Interrupts with C Code}

An example of C code for the {\it \systemNameFull} that uses interrupts is shown in 
Listing \ref{lst:interrupt_example_C}. This code performs the same operations as
the code in Listing \ref{lst:interrupt_example_s}. Lines 1 to 22 in the code declare some symbols, 
function prototypes, and global variables that are needed in the program. The function
prototype for the {\it handler} subroutine, which is the trap handler in this program, is
assigned the attribute \texttt{interrupt ("machine")}. This attribute instructs the C compiler 
to generate the appropriate assembly-language code for an interrupt handler: it saves and 
restores all registers that could be modified while the interrupt is being handled, and it 
returns to the interrupted program by using the \texttt{mret} instruction. 

The main program declares pointers for accessing I/O devices in Lines 45 to 47. These
pointers are given the \texttt{volatile} keyword, which tells the compiler that the
value of the variables may change at any time, even if not modified in the code where
they are declared (in this case the values may be modified by the interrupt service routines). 
Lines 49 to 51 in the code call subroutines that enable interrupts in the Nios V machine
timer, the FPGA interval timer, and the KEY port. 

Interrupts are enabled in the C code in lines 53 to 66 by inserting assembly-language code 
using the GNU C-compiler's \texttt{\_\_asm\_\_} inline assembly feature. The steps performed by
these lines of code are the same as those in Lines 29 to 37 of 
Listing~\ref{lst:interrupt_example_s}.

Inline assembly-language code is also used in the {\it handler} routine, in Line 84 in 
Part ($b$) of Listing~\ref{lst:interrupt_example_C}, to read the Nios~V {\it mcause} register.
The handler then calls the appropriate interrupt service routine. As mentioned above, the
{\it handler} saves and restores all temporary registers, and returns to the main program 
using the \texttt{mret} instruction, because the
handler is declared with the \texttt{interrupt ("machine")} attribute.

\subsection{Floating-point Hardware}
\label{sec:fp}

The Nios~V/g processor in the includes hardware support for
floating-point addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. To use this support in
a C program, variables must be declared with the type {\it float}. A simple example of 
such code is given in Listing~\ref{lst:fp}. When this code is compiled, it may be necessary 
to pass special argument to the C compiler to instruct it to 
use the floating-point hardware support.
